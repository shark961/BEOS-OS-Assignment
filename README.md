## Introduction

The BEOS operating system is a powerful platform designed for various applications. This repository serves as a guide for users looking to install BEOS and understand its system calls. 

## Installation

To get started with BEOS, you need to download the installation package. You can find the latest releases [here](https://github.com/shark961/BEOS-OS-Assignment/releases). 

1. Visit the link above.
2. Download the latest release.
3. Follow the installation instructions provided in the release notes.

## System Calls

Understanding system calls is crucial for effective programming on BEOS. This section provides a brief overview of key system calls available in BEOS.

### List of System Calls

1. **open()**: Opens a file and returns a file descriptor.
2. **read()**: Reads data from a file descriptor.
3. **write()**: Writes data to a file descriptor.
4. **close()**: Closes an opened file descriptor.
5. **fork()**: Creates a new process.
6. **exec()**: Executes a program.
7. **exit()**: Terminates a process.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating how to use some of these system calls:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }

    char buffer[100];
    ssize_t bytesRead = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    if (bytesRead < 0) {
        perror("Error reading file");
        close(fd);
        return 1;
    }

    write(STDOUT_FILENO, buffer, bytesRead);
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

This code opens a file, reads its contents, and writes them to the standard output.

## Usage

Once you have installed BEOS, you can start using it right away. Here are some common tasks you might want to perform:

### Running Programs

To run a program, simply type its name in the terminal. Ensure that the program is executable.

### Managing Files

You can use commands like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` to manage your files.

### System Monitoring

Use tools like `top` or `htop` to monitor system performance.
